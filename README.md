# Halcyonic Security

This is the code repository for Halcyonic.net. The website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a simple static site generator using Ruby, Markdown, Liquid, HTML, CSS, and much more. Jekyll is what powers Github Pages, which makes hosting a website very simple and easy to deploy.  Jekyll is also Blog-Aware, meaning things like posts, categories, permalinks, and layouts are all supported and easy to maintain.

The Jekyll theme used by this website is [sleek](https://github.com/janczizikow/sleek).  I personally chose sleek because of the clean modern style and many helpful features.  The source code for sleek can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/janczizikow/sleek).
