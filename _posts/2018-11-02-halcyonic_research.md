Over the past few months, I have actively contributed to the development and deployment of the [Halcyonic](http://www.halcyonic.net) website.  This site is where I (and occasionally my fellow researchers) will dive into interesting discoveries made in the realm of cybersecurity. The website content will go more in-depth on complex cybersecurity topics for technical individuals in the field, as well as high-level topics for individuals who have no concept of what cybersecurity is. In addition to writing posts, I plan on releasing the tools, data, and software developed during my research over time.  I also plan to contribute to the cyber defense community by analyzing modern social engineering techniques that are commonly utilized, which inevitably lead to large-scale security breaches.  

A few areas of my expertise include IoT (Internet of Things) security, SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks, and ICS (Industrial Control Systems).  Other topics that will be covered on the site (in addition to the ones previously mentioned) include SDR (Software Defined Radio), signal processing, kernel exploits, smart card hacking, physical penetration testing, windows active directory domains, a cybersecurity 101 series for beginners and much more.

You can find the full code for this website as well as any additional repositories I release on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Halcy0nic).
