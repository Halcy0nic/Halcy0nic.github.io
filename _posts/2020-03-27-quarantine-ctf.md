In honor of social distancing, I will be hosting a remote quarantine CTF Thursday, April 2nd, 2020 from 6:00-9:00 PST.  The CTF is completely free and presents five different web application security challenges. You can easily register [here](https://halcyonic.ctfd.io) to secure your spot!

## Details

Any way that you can find the flag is valid in my book. That being said, I do have a few requests:

* Brute forcing passwords is not the intended route for any of the boxes.

* [CTFD](https://ctfd.io/about/) is the framework that's being used to host the CTF so there is a scoreboard, flag submission, etc.

* Fuzzing is definitely in scope, but please be mindful of how many requests are being sent every second.  I'm not sure how much CTFD's infrastructure can handle.

* If you find an unintentional bug (I'm sure there are plenty), kudos!  I would love to hear about it once I post the solutions/containers after the CTF has ended.

* Overall, I would consider the CTF to be focused on beginner-level web exploitation techniques. There are however some slightly harder challenges.  

* The objective of the CTF is to have fun and give everyone constructive things to do while we are all stuck at home.
