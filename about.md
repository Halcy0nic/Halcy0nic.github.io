I'm a cyber security researcher and a composer/musician in my free time.  I love doing CTFs and enjoy researching IoT/SCADA/ICS. This site was built using jekyll and i'm always looking for new ideas and features to add to the website.  The entire site is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Halcy0nic/Halcy0nic.github.io).  As a security researcher I love finding bugs and exploring them, so if you find one here [let me know](https://halcyonic.us/contact/)!
